# Advances in Financial Machine Learning ðŸ“˜

This repository is a structured study and implementation of the key concepts from *"Advances in Financial Machine Learning"* by Marcos LÃ³pez de Prado. The goal is to deepen understanding of the theory while developing practical, reusable Python modules and Jupyter notebooks.

## ðŸ“š Contents

- Code implementations of the book's main techniques (bars, labeling, meta-labeling, sampling, etc.)
- Detailed theoretical notes for each chapter
- Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and visualization
- Utility functions and modular codebase for financial ML workflows
- References to academic papers and supplemental resources
